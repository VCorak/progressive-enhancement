<h1>The story</h1>
<p class="first">
Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. 
  They said, <q class="villagers"><i>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</i></q> The farmer said,  <q class="farmer"><i><strong> Maybe. </strong></i></q></p>

  
<p class="second">
The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,<q class="villagers"><i> Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</i></q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><i><strong> Maybe. </strong></i></q></p>

  
<p class="third">
The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers"><i> Oh dear, that’s too bad,</i></q> and the farmer responded,  <q class="farmer"><i><strong>Maybe.</strong></i></q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,<q class="villagers"><i> Isn’t that great!</i></q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer"><i><strong> Maybe. </strong></i></q></p>

<p class="fourth">
The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <strong class="adjective_one">good</strong> or <strong class="adjective_two">bad</strong> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion </h2>
<blockquote>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</blockquote>
